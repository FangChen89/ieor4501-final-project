# IEORE4501 Tools for Analytics Final Project

## Project Description
In this project, we analyzed yellow taxi rides data, Uber rides data, daily and hourly weather data in New York City from 2009-01 to 2015-06
in order to understand the hired rides in NYC. The main purpose of our project is to explore insights of yellow taxi and Uber market through
different data visualizations.

The processes of our project can be divided into 5 parts:
1. Data Preprocessing - Load, clean, and sample the scraped data about yellow taxi rides and given data about Uber rides and weather
2. Data Storing - Store the prepreocessed data into tables of a Sqlite database
3. Understanding the Data - Query the data from the database using SQL statements
4. Visualizing the Data - Visualize the queried results with different plots and animations
5. Additional Visualization - Visualize the relationship between the duration of sunrise to sunset and the number of hired rides
